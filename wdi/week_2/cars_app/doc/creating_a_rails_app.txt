Creating a Rails App

- Generate a new Rails app (called cars_app) with a PostgreSQL database by running the command,

rails new cars_app --database=postgresql

- Navigate to the cars_app directory and open it in your text editor

- Create a database by running,

rake db:create

- Start Rails on port 3000 by running

rails server

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to check if your Rails app is running (you'll see the welcome page)

- Open the config/routes.rb file and add the following:

get 'cars', to: 'cars#index'

     This creates a route (for the Rails router) to the cars controller that matches the HTTP request's /cars resource path.

- Create a cars controller by running the command

touch app/controllers/cars_controller.rb

- In cars_controller.rb, write the following code:

class CarsController < ApplicationController

  def index
  end

end

(We're creating the CarsController class, which inherits from ApplicationController)


- Create a view: make a cars directory in app/views. In this directory, create a file named index.html.erb and enter any text (for now). Check it by navigating to http://localhost:3000/cars in your browser.

- Populate the database with cars: create a Rails migration that will generate a file that will be used to create a cars table. Run the following two commands:

rails generate migration CreateCars make model year

rake db:migrate

- Next, create a model to access the data in the cars table. Run the command touch app/models/car.rb

- In the model file (car.rb), write the following:

class Car < ActiveRecord::Base

end

(We're creating the Car class, which inherits from ActiveRecord::Base)

- Create cars in the database (10, to be exact). In db/seeds.rb, enter:

1.upto(10) do |num|
  Car.create(make: "Make_#{num}", model: "Model_#{num}", year: "Year_#{num}")
end

- Run the command,

rake db:seed

- In the controller, retrieve all of the cars from the database by adding @cars = Car.all in the file's index method

- In the index.html.erb file, enter the following to populate the view with your cars!

<h2>Cars</h2>
  <ul>
   <% @cars.each do |car| %>
    <li><%= car.make %>, <%= car.model %>, <%= car.year %></li>
    <% end %>
  </ul>

- Now you can access your cars app by going back to http://localhost:3000/cars
